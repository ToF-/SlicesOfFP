Slices of Functional Programming

An exploration of Functional Programming, Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads

Objectives:

- to give a taste of functional programming applied to a mundane problem
- to quickly review some fundamentals of FP in Haskell:
    - Program as function evaluation
    - Strong Typing 
    - Pattern Matching
    - Functions as Values 
    - Referential Transparency
- to explore more advanced constructs
    - Functors
    - Applicative Functors
    - Monads
